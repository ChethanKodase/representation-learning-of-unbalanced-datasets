# representation-learning-of-unbalanced-datasets

### Experiment 1 
Autoencoder reconstruction qualities increased with reduction in imbalance. All autoencoders performed their best(reconstruction qualities in terms of PSNR and SSIM) when all the classes were of equal size. 
In case of reconstruction qualities of unperturbed test samples,  though the Comparative performances of autoencoders remained the same with variations in class imbalance, the individual autoencoders gave better reconstruction qualities.
